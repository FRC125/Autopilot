# Autopilot

Some notes:
- Path name must be a valid Java class name
- Maximum of 10 waypoints (Can be changed under TrajectoryGeneratorActivity)
- Waypoints are in the order they are clicked
- Please be aware after clicking "Generate Trajectory" you have to wait a while, it's very slow!
- After you press the delete option for the path, it will not disappear from the list. The path is deleted! It just doesn't show up in the list, you have to refresh the page, sorry!

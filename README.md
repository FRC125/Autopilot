# Autopilot

Some notes:
- Path name must be a valid Java class name
- Maximum of 10 waypoints (Can be changed under TrajectoryGeneratorActivity)
- Waypoints are in the order they are clicked
- To clear waypoints, you have to click again -- read the little pop up!
- Please be aware after clicking "Generate Trajectory" you have to wait a while, it's very slow!
